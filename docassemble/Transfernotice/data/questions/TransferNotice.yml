question: |
  Transfer to Housing Court
subquestion: |
  You have the right to transfer your case to the Housing Court. Most tenants benefit from transferring their case to the Housing Court.
  
  Depending on your city or town, the Housing Court may be more difficult to get to. You should come up with a plan to get to court on time.
  
  Check the [Housing Court For All](http://www.housingcourt4all.org/where-the-housing-court-sits.html) website
  to learn where the Housing Court sits for your city or town.
  
  #### Why transfer your case to the Housing Court? 
  1. Access to legal aid and [Lawyer for the Day](https://www.mass.gov/service-details/lawyer-for-the-day-programs) programs.
  2. Access to the [Tenancy Preservation Program](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/tenancy-preservation-program).
  3. Access to social service agencies that may help you pay back rent.
  4. Judges who specialize in housing law.
  
  Transferring your case may also postpone your first court hearing by a week or more, depending on your court.
  Transferring is an automatic right. You should check with the clerk in the Housing Court to find out
  where and what day you should appear in court. You may get a notice in the mail. It will most likely not be
  the rescheduled trial date that is printed on the Answer form.
